# project_report_format

For my NESSF, I created a project report format that I have since used predominantly to write
project reports, fellowship applications and technical reports. The report is written using
LaTeX. I have uploaded the individual projects that I used this format for. Please contact me 
for requesting any changes. Thanks!
